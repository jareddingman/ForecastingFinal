# ForecastingFinal
Repo for Jared and Zach's Business Forecasting final project. This is a YOLO image recognition model that has the goal to identify moving baseballs and baseball in videos with the intention of finding exit velocity.

Requirements:
You must have a directory with one folder for CVAT annotations in xml format and another folder for raw baseball videos.

Note that although there is only one py file, it is a class that features many useful functions for obtaining a dataset to use with other neural nets besides YOLO, CVAT xml to YOLO conversion, from-scratch pytensor dataloading, and YOLO model specification.
